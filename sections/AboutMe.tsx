          <p>Hello World!</p>

          <p>
            Welcome to my little corner of the web, which is constantly evolving with updates from different aspects
            of my life.
          </p>

          <p>
            I remember using LOGO and MS BASIC in some early programming classes. I knew at the time that my future lay
            in manipulating ones and zeroes to do my bidding. Later, I dabbled in Visual Basic
            scripting, C++, and Java (which would remain a part of my life for the next decade), along with mySQL. In
            college, deeper knowledge of databases, Java, and Web Development became my main focus.
          </p>

          <p>
            My other interests lie in photography, traveling, learning new things, and sports. The latter, funnily
            enough, played a major role in my decision to pursue Data Science, but that&apos;s a story for another time.
            Currently, I am in my final semester at Syracuse University, on track to complete my Masters in Data Science
            by the end of Spring &apos;25.
          </p>

          <p>
            I created this website because I truly believe that the best way to learn something is by building it.
            Instead of taking the easy route with no-code solutions, I decided to brush up on my Web Development skills.
            If you would like to connect with me, head on over to the{" "}
